## Introduction: Welcome to the Nutrition Challenge!

> Let food be thy medicine.

### Why Focus on Nutrition?

This challenge is based on the principle of Hippocrates: 'Let food be your medicine, and your medicine be food.' The goal is to help the body eat and drink better to stay healthy and strong. The focus is on a varied diet with little sugar and fat. The premise is that our bodies are still adapted to a hunter-gatherer diet, which contrasts with the current abundance of fat and sugar.

### What to Expect

For two weeks, you will be challenged to: drink no calories (only coffee, tea, and water without sugar), optionally use no added sugar and no sweets or snacks, photograph everything you eat and drink and review it each evening, and weigh yourself at the start and end of the challenge. The first step is to start!

## Day 1: You Are How You Eat

> **Saying:** "Nutrition as medicine"

**Summary:** Healthy eating provides energy, maintains the body, and protects against dementia.

### Sections
- **More Energy:** Three healthy meals provide enough energy throughout the day. You eat to get useful substances for energy and to maintain your body.
- **Better Concentration:** The brain works better with healthy food. Sugar works only for a short time and makes you sluggish; you first need to recover from an excess.
- **Better Choices:** You make the best choices when you are free from fluctuations in your energy. If you are hungry while shopping, you buy more snacks and unhealthy options.
- **Better Memory:** Healthy food affects memory and protects against dementia.
- **Better Stress Management:** Mental resistance decreases with more energy fluctuations, leading to irritability or sluggishness.
- **Physical Health:** The body needs the right building blocks to make cells, with varied eating being more effective than too much of one substance.

- **Better Mood:** Nutrition is important for regulating mood and emotion; unhealthy food causes more fluctuations.

**Read More:** General advice: plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-based fats and proteins, not too much animal fats and proteins, drinking calorie-free beverages, and especially not eating too much. More information is easy to find via Voedingscentrum.nl. There is also a tool to measure how many calories are needed per day (Calorie meter).

## Day 2: Healthy Eating Habits

> **Saying:** "That's the whole shebang."

**Summary:** Healthy eating habits are essential for the body to save energy and allow the digestive system to work optimally.

### Sections
- **Routine:** Eat at fixed times and have three meals a day, so the body can start digestion at fixed times and waste less energy. The body loves regularity.
- **Sufficient Sleep:** With enough sleep, the hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin are better balanced, so you don’t eat more than necessary.
- **Avoid Stress:** Stress hormones stimulate the body to store more reserves, which leads to more cravings for sugar and fat and the choice for quick meals.
- **Eat Varied:** The body needs different foods; small amounts of different foods are more effective than a lot of one, especially more fruits and vegetables.
- **Don't Work Through, Take Time to Eat:** Digestion works better when you are relaxed and the body is only concerned with digestion.
- **Sufficient Movement:** Movement helps digestion and metabolism; the muscles support the function of the organs. This burns calories and helps maintain a healthy weight. Light exercise is better during meals.
- **Disruptive Substances:** Caffeine, smoking, and alcohol disrupt appetite and digestion. Coffee is best taken after a meal. Alcohol and smoking are almost never wise.
- **Drink Enough Water:** Drinking enough helps the body get rid of waste products and is necessary for the body fluids involved in digestion.

**Read More:** Tricks to eat less: use tricks to not overdo it, ensure healthy choices, and thus maintain better balance. Eat only to nourish the body, not to fill it.

### Quiz
1.  **Why is eating at regular times beneficial?**
    -   It makes you more tired 😴
    -   It helps the body save energy ⚡️ (Correct)
    -   It's a bad habit 👎

## Day 3: Your Digestion

> **Saying:** 'Appetite comes with eating.'

**Summary:** A well-functioning digestive system is crucial for the absorption of food and energy, and it works best with regularity.

### Sections
- **Your Mouth:** Digestion begins with digestive enzymes (saliva) and the grinding of food by teeth and tongue. Enjoy variation and less of too much.
- **Esophagus:** Food goes to the stomach via the esophagus. By drinking well and not eating too much at once, you prevent hiccups and burping, which indicate eating too fast and too much.
- **Stomach:** Contains acid that further breaks down food. When the stomach expands, it releases leptin, a hormone that gives a feeling of fullness. Drinking causes the stomach to expand less, so you can drink many more calories than you can eat before feeling full.
- **Small Intestine:** Most food is absorbed here. Bile (from the gallbladder) helps with fat absorption. Digestive enzymes (from the pancreas) help break down and absorb proteins and carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins, and salts.
- **Large Intestine:** Mainly absorbs moisture and removes food residues. Fiber and moisture are essential for proper function.
- **Liver:** All blood from the intestines first passes through the liver to purify harmful substances. The healthier you eat and drink, the easier it is for the liver, leaving you with more energy for other things.

**Read More:** Digestion is rhythmic and loves regularity. Deviations in the rhythm (like skipping a meal or traveling to another time zone) lead to a mismatch, which is felt as hunger, acid, cramps, and queasy complaints. Nothing beats a good, healthy meal.

### Quiz
1.  **Where does digestion begin?**
    -   In the stomach 🤔
    -   In the mouth 👄 (Correct)
    -   In the small intestine 🤷

## Day 7: Sugar

> **Saying:** "Keeping it sweet"

**Summary:** An excess of sugar, which we now consume on average 150 grams per day, can have significant negative consequences for the entire body.

### Sections
- **Brain:** Too much sugar can worsen anxiety, reduce concentration, cause mood swings (especially in children), worsen ADHD, disrupt learning, and can lead to sugar addiction.
- **Eyes:** Too much sugar increases the risk of various eye diseases.
- **Skin:** Too much sugar accelerates skin aging. Elasticity decreases because the protein collagen is produced less well, which also affects the joints.

## Day 8: Salt

> **Saying:** "Worth your salt"

**Summary:** Although salt is important, we currently consume too much of it, which has a detrimental effect on health.

### Sections
- **Consequences:** Salt raises blood pressure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Salt also retains fluid in the body.
- **Intake:** The daily recommended amount is 1500–2300 milligrams. On average, we eat 3400 mg per day, and many people even more than 7000 mg.
- **Source:** Salt is mainly in prepared meals and snacks. Read the labels and choose snacks carefully.
- **Health:** People who eat less salt stay healthier.

**Read More:** Our kidneys have to process more salt than they would naturally retain, which costs extra energy. Our taste is adapted to appreciate salt because it used to be scarce, but this now quickly leads to an excess. We need to be wiser and consciously choose less salt.

### Quiz
1.  **What is a major consequence of eating too much salt?**
    -   Lower blood pressure 📉
    -   Higher blood pressure 📈 (Correct)

## Day 9: Fats

> **Saying:** "Getting a greasy mouth"

**Summary:** It is important to choose unsaturated fats and reduce the intake of saturated fats.

### Sections
- **Go for fish:** Fish has more unsaturated fatty acids and is therefore healthier, especially fatty fish.
- **Eat nuts:** Nuts are a healthy source of unsaturated fats. When nuts are roasted, some of the fats turn into saturated fats, making them less healthy.
- **Avocado:** Avocado is an excellent substitute for animal fats and contains healthy fats.
- **Use vegetable oil:** Choose vegetable oil with as many unsaturated fats as possible.
- **Reduce animal fat:** Reduce animal fat, such as meat, cheese, and dairy products.
- **Eat as few cookies and pastries as possible:** These are full of saturated fats.

**Read More:** Fat is an important source of energy. Unsaturated fats are healthier because they are easier to break down and have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Saturated fats indicate a higher risk of cancer. About 70% of fats are used as an energy source; an excess is stored as a reserve. The supply of saturated fats in the modern diet is disproportionately large. Check packaging more often to adjust the choice to less fat.

### Quiz
1.  **Which type of fat is considered healthier?**
    -   Saturated fat 🍔

## Day 10: Protein

> **Saying:** "The building blocks. Who wants to be strong"

**Summary:** Proteins are the energy-rich building blocks of our body and crucial for satiety and endurance.

### Sections
- **Fish and meat:** Contains a lot of proteins, which are generally more complex and harder to break down and digest. White meat like chicken is easier to digest.
- **Dairy products and eggs:** Important sources of proteins and calcium. A disadvantage is an increased cholesterol.
- **Beans:** A plant-based source of proteins; these are easier to break down. In the past, we ate more plant-based proteins.
- **Seeds and nuts:** Contain simpler proteins and are more easily processed than animal proteins.

**Read More:** Proteins are the building blocks of our blood, muscles, immune system, bones, ligaments, and hormones. Without proteins, the body weakens and you lose muscle mass. Protein-rich food provides a faster and longer feeling of satiety. Proteins are needed for endurance, and without replenishment, you lose this and get tired quickly. Extra proteins are needed when sick or after a wound for recovery.

### Quiz
1.  **What are proteins the building blocks for?**
    -   Only muscles 💪
    -   Blood, muscles, immune system, and more 🧬 (Correct)

- **Vitamin B group:** Water-soluble vitamins, including B12 and folic acid. Deficiencies: Rare with enough vegetables and meat. B12: Vegetarians can get it from nuts.

**Read More:** Most vitamins (A, E, K) and minerals (zinc, selenium, copper) are amply obtained with a varied diet. Deficiencies only occur with an underlying condition or a one-sided diet. The sale of vitamins is enormous, which leads to more overdoses than deficiencies. "Just enough is always the best".

### Quiz
1.  **What is necessary to activate Vitamin D in the body?**
    -   Drinking milk 🥛
    -   Sunlight on the skin ☀️ (Correct)

### Sections
- **The Metabolic Syndrome:** A combination of an increase in fat around the abdomen, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and increased triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood.
- **This causes: Hormonal Disruption:** Mainly stress hormones, but also hunger hormones and reproductive hormones. This poses an extra health risk.
- **This causes: More Fat Deposition:** More fat deposition around your abdomen: This belly fat produces its own hormones and makes movement more uncomfortable.
- **This causes: Coronary Artery Narrowing:** Due to cholesterol deposition in the vessel walls around the heart. The heart can thus deliver less effort due to oxygen deficiency in the heart muscle.
- **This causes: Inactivity:** You become slower and your condition further decreases, and you get tired faster.
- **This causes: Type 2 Diabetes:** This also lowers your energy and effort.
- **This causes: Accelerated Aging**
- **The Cause:** Besides predisposition, the cause is lifestyle. Wrong nutrition and inactivity bring you into a vicious circle from which it is increasingly difficult to escape. The further you are, the harder it is to change course; help can be sought immediately for this.

### Quiz

- **Absorption Disorder:** Some conditions can ensure that certain foods are not absorbed.

**Read More:** Many factors lead to malnutrition, including a one-sided diet. Sometimes people still look overweight, but their muscle mass is already significantly decreasing. Staying healthy is not growing too much and not shrinking too much.

### Quiz
1.  **What happens to the risk of malnutrition as people get older?**
    -   It decreases 📉
    -   It increases 📈 (Correct)
    -   It stays the same 🤷
