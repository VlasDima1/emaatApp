## Introduction: Welcome to the Movement Challenge!

> Ready to integrate more movement into your daily life?

### Why Focus on Movement?

More and more studies show that movement is essential for the functioning of our body and brain. Our ancestors walked an average of 20 kilometers a day; this need for movement has largely disappeared, with all its consequences.

### What to Expect

For 15 days, you will be challenged to start each morning with a short physical exercise and to take at least your target number of steps daily. The first step is to set your personal goal!

**Summary:** This day emphasizes the clear benefits of sufficient movement on both physical and mental health, and the need to push your body to find a new, fitter balance.

### Sections

**Summary:** Focuses on the rapid and persistent negative consequences of inactivity on the body, from muscle and bone loss to mental and digestive issues, and the vicious cycle it creates.

### Sections
- **Muscles:** Rapid loss of muscle mass with inactivity. It takes much longer to regain strength and fitness than it took to lose them.
- **Bones:** Become weaker, increasing the risk of fractures in a fall. Rebuilding takes longer than losing. Strong bones are largely in your own hands.

## Day 8: Disadvantages of Sitting

> **Saying:** 'Standstill.'

**Summary:** Warns about the adverse effects of prolonged sitting on the entire body, from the neck and back to the intestines and ankles, and provides concrete tips to break this habit.

### Sections
- **Neck Complaints and Headaches:** Often the result of hours in a tense posture at a desk. Changes to the skull can even be seen from staring at mobile phones.
- **Back Complaints:** Prolonged sitting keeps back muscles in the same position, causing continuous strain and affecting blood flow. The risk increases when alternated with heavy lifting without a warm-up.
- **Intestinal Complaints:** Longer sitting increases the risk of colon cancer and constipation, as movement stimulates the intestines and propels stool.
- **Joint Complaints:** Joints become stiff and joint fluid decreases, leading to stiff, painful joints and an increased risk of wear and tear.
- **Swollen Ankles and Varicose Veins:** Walking pumps blood back to the heart. Prolonged sitting leads to fluid retention in the legs, damaged veins, and an increased risk of varicose veins.

**Read More:** Tips: Set up your workspace ergonomically. Check your posture every half hour. Do 2 minutes of small stretching exercises every half hour. Walk a lap or take the stairs between tasks. Drink enough water and get it frequently. Have walking meetings instead of sitting meetings.

### Quiz
1.  **What is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting at a desk?**

- **Playing Sports Together:** Go to a sport together, especially if you can do it together. This is good for you and good for them.

### Sections
- **Learning and Mental Performance:** Physical exercise improves learning and mental performance; fitness is linked to a higher IQ, better school results, and reaction time. This improvement is found in everyone who starts moving more.
- **Memory:** Movement increases activity in the temporal lobe, where memory is stored. More connections are made, making information easier to retrieve.
- **Hormones:** Endorphins and GABA are produced, which reduce pain, create a feeling of happiness, and help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.
- **Disease and Aging:** Reduces the chance of brain aging, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Also slows the decline of coordination in Parkinson's disease.
- **Attention and Concentration:** Increases in young people after just 10 minutes of sports and reduces symptoms in children with ADHD.
- **Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF):** More of this substance in people who move more, which stimulates the nervous system to repair and even grow.
- **Blood Vessels:** The blood vessels in the brain also benefit, ensuring a better supply of nutrients and oxygen, and thus better function.

**Read More:** For studying or better performance at work, you should plan both studying and physical exercise. Every movement helps; you don't have to become a top athlete right away.

### Quiz
1.  **What substance, which stimulates the nervous system, is found more in people who exercise?**

- **Housework:** About 450 calories in 130 minutes (about 1 hamburger bun).
- **Swimming:** About 320 calories in 40 minutes (about 2 cheese sandwiches).

## Day 13: The Right Fuel

> **Saying:** 'The right fuel for movement and nutrition.'

**Summary:** Focuses on the optimal nutrition strategy around exercise, with advice on timing and the type of food (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) for maximum energy and recovery.

### Sections
- **Eating Before Exercise:** The best time is between 1 to 3 hours before exercise. Avoid fatty foods and too much protein, as they take longer to digest and hinder performance. Carbohydrates are good as they release energy gradually.
- **During Exercise:** You want to get sugars in quickly, for example, with fruit (banana) or dextrose. Ensure a gradual and regular supply of sugar, for example, through carbohydrates, because pure sugar is quickly used up after a peak.
- **After Exercise (Recovery):** Good to replenish reserves and consumed substances: Vitamin C for damage, proteins to repair muscle cells, and fats and sugars for energy.
- **Hydration:** Don't forget to drink enough water before and after exercise, as your body will recover less well otherwise.

**Read More:** If you have just eaten, more blood goes to your intestines and your nervous system adjusts to rest and digestion, which inhibits performance. During recovery, muscle and connective tissue are repaired stronger; proteins, vitamins, and antioxidants are important then.

### Quiz
1.  **What type of food is best to eat 1-3 hours before exercising?**
    -   A fatty meal 🍔
    -   Carbohydrates 🍌 (Correct)
    -   A large portion of protein 🍗

- **Weather:** Don't let the weather determine your fitness; think of weather-independent alternatives.
- **Vacations:** Ideal moments to work on your fitness. Plan physical activities like brisk walks or swimming.
- **Challenges:** Participating in a strenuous activity twice a year helps to stay in shape and motivates you to persevere.
- **Help:** You don't have to do it alone; working with family, a club, a coach, or friends works.
- **Other Motivation:** Put something at stake: promise to do something unpleasant if you don't stick to a plan. Donating money to a bad cause is a stronger motivator than paying, as you are not just buying it off.

**Read More:** To change behavior, you need to plan things and take them as seriously as your work or a doctor's prescription.

### Quiz
1.  **What is a good way to stay motivated for exercise long-term?**
