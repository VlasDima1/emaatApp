## Introduction: Welcome to the Quit Smoking Challenge!

> A strange hobby...

### Why Quit Smoking?

Smoking is a stubborn form of self-poisoning. The tobacco plant's self-defense mechanism leads to our health problems. We've learned to bypass the nausea it causes in nature. This challenge is designed to help you successfully reduce and quit smoking.

### What to Expect

We challenge you not to smoke indoors or while driving. Take responsibility for the waste smoking creates. Additionally, for every cigarette you smoke, take a photo in the app and write down why you're lighting it. This helps you track when and why you smoke, which is crucial for quitting.

## Day 1: Benefits of Quitting

> **Saying:** 'Every cigarette not smoked is a win, not a loss.'

**Summary:** Quitting smoking has immediate and long-term benefits, from more energy and money to better health and a longer life.

### Sections
- **More Energy:** Smoking reduces oxygen in your blood, making your heart and lungs work harder. When you quit, your body can transport oxygen better, and you’ll notice activities like climbing stairs become easier within days.
- **More Air – Literally:** After about 24 hours, your body stops taking in carbon monoxide and begins a major cleanup in your lungs. You might cough up more mucus temporarily, which is a good sign of recovery.
- **More Money:** If you smoke one pack a day at €8, you save approximately €240 per month, €1,440 in six months, and €2,880 in a year. Calculate your exact savings!
- **More Time:** Smoking takes up a lot of time. Quitting gives you extra time for things you find important or enjoyable.
- **Better Sleep:** Nicotine is a stimulant that disrupts sleep. After initial withdrawal, ex-smokers generally sleep better than smokers.
- **Less Distraction:** As a smoker, you often think about when you can smoke. After a few weeks of quitting, you’ll notice better concentration.
- **Better Choices:** Successfully quitting smoking gives you a sense of control, making it easier to make other healthy choices.
- **Better Physical Health:** After 1 year, the risk of cardiovascular disease is halved. After 10 years, the risk of lung cancer is halved. Non-smokers live about 10 years longer on average.
- **Better Resistance:** Quitting smoking improves your immune system, making you less susceptible to infections.
- **Better Mood:** While many think smoking reduces stress, it often increases it in the long run. After quitting, anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms often decrease.

**Read More:** Find more facts and figures about smoking and quitting from reliable sources like the Trimbos Institute and RIVM.

**Assignment:** Write in your journal in the app: “Why do I want to quit/reduce?” Make a list of at least 5 benefits that are most important to you personally. Today, for every cigarette, take a photo in the app and note: where was I? with whom? how did I feel?

## Day 2: Disadvantages of Smoking

> **Saying:** "It's not a bad habit, it's an expensive disease."

**Summary:** Smoking affects almost every organ in your body and is the leading cause of many serious diseases, including various types of cancer and cardiovascular problems.

### Sections
- **What Smoke Does to Your Body:** Smoking affects almost every organ in your body: lungs, heart, blood vessels, skin, mouth, intestines, and even your brain.
- **Cancer and Other Serious Diseases:** About 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking. It also increases the risk of throat, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, and cervical cancer. COPD is also mostly caused by smoking.
- **Heart and Blood Vessels:** Smoking damages the inner lining of blood vessels, causing arteries to narrow and clog more easily. This increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.
- **Appearance and Daily Complaints:** Faster skin aging (wrinkles, dull complexion), bad breath, yellow teeth, discolored fingers, more coughing, wheezing, and faster shortness of breath.
- **Addiction: Why "Quitting" is Tough:** Nicotine acts on receptors in the brain, causing the brain to adapt by creating more receptors. This means you need to smoke more often for the same effect and feel restless without a cigarette.

**Read More:** Learn more about the specific consequences of smoking on your health from official sources like the RIVM and KWF.

**Assignment:** Make an honest list today: what does smoking concretely cost you? Think about health, money, smell, fitness, shame, time. Place this list next to your benefits list from Day 1. Again, for every cigarette, take a photo in the app and note: "What disadvantage of smoking do I already feel in my life?"

---

## Day 3: Smoking and Your Immune System

> **Saying:** 'Your defense deserves better.'

**Summary:** Tobacco smoke weakens your immune system, making your immune cells less effective and slower to respond to pathogens, leading to more frequent illnesses and slower healing.

### Sections
- **How Smoking Undermines Your Defenses:** Tobacco smoke weakens your immune system: your immune cells work less effectively and react more slowly to pathogens, resulting in more frequent colds, respiratory infections, and slower wound healing.
- **Secondhand Smoke is Also Harmful:** Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home have a demonstrably higher incidence of ear infections and respiratory infections. Partners and housemates also have an increased risk of lung and heart diseases.
- **Long-Term Impact:** New research shows that smoking causes changes in the immune system that can partially persist for years after quitting. Fortunately, some parts do recover, especially if you quit at a younger age.
- **Smoking, Viruses, and Cancer:** For example, with HPV (the virus that can cause cervical cancer), smoking appears to weaken the immune system and increase the chance of malignant cell changes.

**Read More:** Learn more about the link between smoking and health from the Trimbos Institute.

**Assignment:** Note in your journal: "When was the last time I was seriously ill, and was I smoking then?" Write down which people in your environment are particularly vulnerable (baby, child, pregnant person, someone with asthma/lung disease). Challenge: no smoking indoors today (home, car, work). Write down how it went.

---

## Day 4: Smoking and Psyche

> **Saying:** "It's not a stress solution."

**Summary:** You are dampening withdrawal stress, not your real stress. Smoking is often seen as self-medication for stress, but research shows it can actually increase the risk of mental health problems.

### Sections
- **Smoking and Mental Health:** People with stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms smoke more often on average. While long thought to be self-medication, research now shows that smoking itself increases the risk of mental health problems.
- **The Nicotine Trap:** You smoke, nicotine levels rise, and you feel calm for a moment. As nicotine levels drop, you experience withdrawal symptoms: restlessness, irritability, and concentration problems. You think, "See, smoking helps," but you are mainly quelling withdrawal stress.
- **Quitting and Your Mood:** After quitting, you may temporarily be irritable, restless, or somber. This is part of withdrawal and usually improves within weeks to a few months. Afterward, many ex-smokers feel more stable and cheerful than when they smoked.
- **Smoking and Focus:** Nicotine provides a short concentration boost, but because you need to refuel often, you are less focused in the long run. Without nicotine, your brain fluctuates less between "high" and "craving."

**Read More:** Find more information about the link between smoking, stress, and mental health on websites like ikstopnu.nl and the Trimbos Institute.

**Assignment:** Score your mood 3 times today (morning, afternoon, evening) on a scale of 1–10 in your journal. Also note: smoked? craving? Think of 3 non-smoking solutions for stress (e.g., short walk, music, messaging a buddy, breathing exercise) and test at least one today.

## Day 5: Smoking and Physicality

> **Saying:** 'Your body talks, are you listening?'

**Summary:** Smoking has a direct negative impact on your physical condition, appearance, and even your fertility. This day focuses on the tangible physical consequences you might already be experiencing.

### Sections
- **Condition and Sports:** Smoking narrows your airways, reduces lung capacity, and increases your heart rate and blood pressure. The result: you get out of breath faster, have less stamina, and recover more slowly after exertion.
- **Skin, Hair, and Teeth:** Skin ages faster due to reduced blood flow and more breakdown of connective tissue, leading to wrinkles and a dull complexion. Hair looks duller. Teeth and nails discolor, and gum inflammation is more common.
- **Stomach and Intestines:** Smoking increases the risk of stomach ulcers, reflux complaints, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer.
- **Sexuality and Fertility:** For men: more erectile problems due to poorer blood circulation. For women: more difficulty getting pregnant and a higher chance of complications during pregnancy.
- **Pregnancy and Baby:** Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, a low birth weight baby, and SIDS. Secondhand smoke is also harmful to the unborn child.

**Read More:** Explore detailed information from RIVM and VZinfo on how smoking affects every part of your body.

**Assignment:** Do a stair test: walk up 2–3 flights of stairs and count how long it takes for your breathing to return to normal. Note this in your journal (day 5). Write down three physical things you would like to improve (e.g., sports performance, skin, breathing, pregnancy).

## Day 6: Smoking and Weight

> **Saying:** 'Afraid of kilos, but what does health weigh?'

**Summary:** A few extra kilos are less severe than a lifetime of illness. This day addresses the fear of weight gain after quitting and provides strategies to manage it.

### Sections
- **Why Some People Gain Weight After Quitting:** After quitting, your metabolism slows slightly, your sense of taste and smell improve (making food more appealing), and you sometimes use food as a substitute for a cigarette. On average, quitters gain a few kilos, but this is not a given.
- **Health vs. Kilos:** The health benefits of quitting are so significant that a few extra kilos are much less serious than continuing to smoke. The risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer drops sharply after quitting, even if you gain some weight.
- **Smart Snacking for "Oral Fixation":** Choose sugar-free gum, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, or ice water. Use your hands: a stress ball, a pen, a rubber band, or a fidget toy. Drink enough water and tea.
- **Movement Helps Twice Over:** Movement reduces cigarette cravings, limits weight gain, and improves mood and sleep. A few short walks a day are already a win.

**Read More:** Find more information on quitting and weight management from health organizations and on ikstopnu.nl.

**Assignment:** Make a list of smoke-free snacks you enjoy and get a few. Choose one extra moment for movement today (e.g., a 10-minute walk).

## Day 7: Societal Impact of Smoking

> **Saying:** "You never smoke alone."

**Summary:** Your cigarette also affects people who don't smoke. This day highlights the broader consequences of smoking on public health, children, and society's costs.

### Sections
- **Illness and Mortality in the Netherlands:** In the Netherlands, an estimated nearly 700,000 people are chronically ill due to smoking (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, COPD). Every year, about 20,000 people die from the consequences of smoking.
- **Children and Young People:** More than 40 children a day start smoking in the Netherlands. Children exposed to secondhand smoke more often have ear infections, lung problems, and asthma.
- **Costs for Healthcare and Society:** Smoking costs billions in healthcare costs, absenteeism, and reduced productivity. So, you are not just smoking "individually"; the consequences affect the entire society.
- **Tobacco Industry and Marketing:** The tobacco industry profits from addiction. Products are deliberately designed to get you addicted quickly and for a long time. Marketing often targets young people and vulnerable groups.
- **Quitting as a Statement:** By quitting, you show that you no longer participate in an industry that sells disease, you become an example for your friends, family, and (future) children.

**Read More:** Learn more about the societal consequences of smoking from the Trimbos Institute and the Dutch government.

**Assignment:** Write in your journal: "What do I think of the tobacco industry now that I know this?" Think about who in your environment would benefit from you quitting (at least 3 people or groups).

---

## Day 8: Quitting Until You Quit

> **Saying:** 'Failed attempts do not exist, only practice rounds.'

**Summary:** Most smokers need multiple attempts to quit for good. This isn't failure; it's how addiction works. Learning from past attempts is key to making the next one successful.

### Sections
- **Why Multiple Attempts are Normal:** Most smokers need several quit attempts before they succeed for good. That's not failure; that's how addiction works.
- **Reducing vs. Quitting:** Just 'reducing' usually doesn't provide the same health benefits as quitting completely and often leads to a relapse to the old level. However, reducing can be useful as a lead-up to a concrete quit date.
- **Learning from Previous Attempts:** Ask yourself 3 questions about past attempts: What worked well? Where did it go wrong? What do I need now to do it differently?
- **Making a Quit Plan:** Choose a quit date (within 2–4 weeks). Write down your reasons for quitting (day 1), your pitfalls, and your resources (buddy, apps, doctor). Discuss your plan with someone.

**Read More:** Find help and facts about quitting from the Trimbos Institute.

**Assignment:** Enter your quit date in the app (or note in your journal that you will choose one this week). Briefly write out your previous quit attempts: attempt – what helped – what did I learn?

---

## Day 9: What If You Can't Quit?

> **Saying:** "Not a willpower problem, but a treatable addiction."

**Summary:** You don't have to do it alone. Nicotine addiction changes your brain, making 'just quitting' feel almost impossible. This isn't a character flaw; professional help and medication can significantly increase your chances of success.

### Sections
- **It's an Addiction, Not a Character Flaw:** Nicotine addiction changes your brain, making 'just quitting' feel almost impossible. This doesn't mean you are weak, but that you have a powerful addiction.
- **Professional Help Really Works:** Quitting with help (coach, group, doctor) roughly doubles your chance of successfully quitting. Options include a quit-smoking coach, your GP, a telephone Quitline, or online programs and apps.
- **Medication and Nicotine Replacement:** There are aids that can help, such as nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and prescription medications. They reduce withdrawal symptoms, giving you more space to change your habits.
- **If It Never Worked Before:** See every failed attempt as data, not drama. Ask for help: 'I really want to quit, but I've tried everything. What else can we do?' It's never too late to gain health benefits—even if you've been smoking for a long time.

**Read More:** Find overviews of help and resources at ikstopnu.nl and the Trimbos Institute.

**Assignment:** Note which form of help you would be willing to try (at least 2). Find one concrete contact (website, phone number, GP) and put it in your journal.

## Day 10: Smoking and Your Environment

> **Saying:** 'Who smokes with you?'

**Summary:** Your smoke is their air. This day covers the impact of secondhand and thirdhand smoke on others, especially children, and how smoking affects social relationships.

### Sections
- **Secondhand Smoke:** Increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and respiratory infections in children.
- **Thirdhand Smoke:** Smoke particles remain in curtains, furniture, cars, and clothing. Babies and young children can ingest these through their hands and mouths.
- **Relationships and Social Situations:** Some partners or friends find the smell of smoke unpleasant. Smoking can cause arguments ("not in the house," "not around the children"). Conversely, you might feel excluded when you have to "step outside for a smoke."
- **Setting Boundaries – Smoke-Free Zones:** No more smoking in the house or car. Agree with friends: "I prefer to smoke separately, or rather not when you are around." Ask others to smoke out of your sight if you want to quit.

**Read More:** Read about the risks of secondhand smoke from official government and health information sources.

**Assignment:** Draw a map of your smoking zones (home, car, work) in your journal. Designate at least one zone to be smoke-free starting today. Write down who you will ask to support you (partner, friend, colleague).

## Day 11: Health Costs of Smoking

> **Saying:** "You don't just pay with money, but with years."

**Summary:** What does one pack really cost? This day breaks down the direct financial costs of smoking, as well as the indirect costs related to health, work, and emotional well-being.

### Sections
- **Direct Costs: Money:** Example calculation: 1 pack/day at €8 → approx. €240 per month → approx. €2,880 per year. In 10 years, that's almost €30,000—excluding price increases.
- **Indirect Costs: Health:** High risk of chronic diseases like COPD, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. More hospital admissions, tests, and medications.
- **Work & Income:** On average, smoking leads to more sick leave, lower productivity (smoke breaks, poorer fitness), and sometimes earlier disability due to lung or heart disease.
- **Emotional Costs:** Shame about the smell, coughing, or fitness. Fear of illness ("I dare not go to the lung specialist"). Guilt towards children/family.

**Read More:** Explore the societal consequences of smoking through data from RIVM/VZinfo.

**Assignment:** Let an app or a calculator figure out how much you would save in 1, 5, and 10 years if you quit. Think of a reward goal: what would you want to do with 6 or 12 months of savings? (vacation, scooter, education, tattoo, concerts...).

---

## Day 12: Tools & Apps

> **Saying:** 'Use the tools, not just willpower.'

**Summary:** Smart quitting is stronger than quitting alone. This day introduces various digital and personal tools—from apps to buddies—that can significantly increase your chances of success.

### Sections
- **Apps for Young Adults and Adults:** Apps like Quiddy, Quit Buddy, QuitNow!, Kwit, and Smoke Free track your progress, savings, health, and cravings, and reward you with badges. They help with insight, direct support during cravings, and motivation.
- **Online Help & Websites:** Websites like ikstopnu.nl and rokeninfo.nl offer info, tests, tips, and access to Quitlines. Programs are also available through health insurers or the GGD.
- **Coaching & Buddy:** Online coaching, telephone support, and group programs increase your chance of success. A buddy with a similar reason to quit works extra motivationally.
- **Emergency Button Strategy:** Use a personal emergency button for cravings: open your app (game, community, chat), call/message your buddy or the Quitline, or do an alternative action (game, video, walk, workout).

**Read More:** Explore the different apps and resources available at quiddy.nl and ikstopnu.nl to find what works best for you.

**Assignment:** Choose at least one app or online program and install/register. Decide who your buddy will be and ask them today.

## Day 13: Difficult Moments & Cravings

> **Saying:** 'A craving for a cigarette is a wave, not a tsunami.'

**Summary:** A craving always passes. This day focuses on recognizing your triggers and provides concrete strategies, like the 4D method, to manage cravings when they arise.

### Sections
- **Recognize Your Triggers:** Common smoking moments: after eating, during a break, in the car, with stress or boredom, while going out/with alcohol. Knowing your triggers helps you prepare for them.
- **The 4D Method for Cravings:** Delay (postpone the cigarette for 10 minutes), Deep breathe (5–10 calm, deep breaths), Drink water or tea, Do something else (a short task, text someone, go outside). The worst craving usually subsides within 5–10 minutes.
- **Boredom & Going Out:** Plan what you will do when others go out to smoke (go with them with something in your hands, or stay inside to dance/talk). Combine quitting with new habits: puzzles, sports, creative hobbies, short game sessions.
- **Stressful Moments:** Use a short brain-break instead of a smoke break: listen to music, do a breathing exercise, take a short walk, or message your buddy/chat in your quit app.

**Read More:** Find more tips for difficult moments on ikstopnu.nl and within various quit-smoking apps.

**Assignment:** Write down your top 5 triggers in your journal (moment, place, feeling). For each trigger, devise one smoke-free alternative (e.g., "after eating → brush teeth + glass of water").

---

## Day 14: Your Motivation & Rewards

> **Saying:** 'What you give attention to, grows—so feed your motivation.'

**Summary:** Make being smoke-free attractive. This day focuses on strengthening your personal 'why' for quitting and creating a concrete reward plan to celebrate your milestones.

### Sections
- **Internal vs. External Motivation:** Internal: health, children, pregnancy, pride, freedom, smell, fitness. External: money, pressure from partner/family, work rules. Internal motivation is often stronger in the long term, but external motivation helps too.
- **Your Personal 'Why':** You have already listed benefits (day 1) and drawbacks (day 2). Now choose the 3 most important reasons why you really want to quit. Examples: "I want to be able to play with my children/grandchildren later," "I don't want to get sick like...," "I want to spend my money on fun things, not cigarettes."
- **Reward Plan:** Link concrete rewards to milestones: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. Examples: 3 days: a tasty treat. 1 month: new shoes, a video game, a night out. 3 months: a weekend away.
- **Visualize Your Smoke-Free Future:** Imagine: What do you look like in 1 year, smoke-free? What can you physically do again (sports, climbing stairs, traveling)? How does your house/car smell?

**Read More:** Find more about motivation and quitting at ikstopnu.nl and the Trimbos Institute.

**Assignment:** Write a smoke-free letter to yourself: "Dear me in 6 months..." Create a reward ladder in the app or on paper with at least 5 rewards.

---

## Day 15: Your Long-Term Smoke-Free Plan

> **Saying:** 'Today is not the end, but the beginning.'

**Summary:** Being smoke-free is not a 15-day challenge, but a daily choice. This final day is about creating a sustainable plan for the future, including how to handle a potential relapse.

### Sections
- **Relapse = Part of the Process:** If you smoke again after (temporarily) quitting, you're not back to square one. Every smoke-free day has taught your body and brain something. Use a relapse as information, not as an excuse to continue smoking.
- **Relapse Plan:** Write down what you will do if you smoke one cigarette, buy a whole pack, or have been smoking for a few days again. For example: Stop again immediately, discuss it with your buddy/coach/doctor, look in your journal to identify the trigger.
- **Strengthen Your New Identity:** Don't say: "I'm trying to quit." Say: "I am someone who doesn't smoke." Even when the craving is strong. Your brain will get used to this new role.
- **Keep Using Your Tools:** Continue to use your app/journal (cravings, milestones, savings). Stay in touch with your buddy, especially during difficult times. Celebrate your smoke-free anniversary annually.
- **Look Back on 15 Days:** What have you learned about yourself, your triggers, your motivation? What will you concretely do in the next 30 days? What help will you possibly still enlist?

**Read More:** Find tips on staying smoke-free for the long term at ikstopnu.nl.

**Assignment:** Write your personal smoke-free plan for the next 3 months: my reasons, my tools, my relapse plan, my rewards. Share this plan with at least one person you trust.
